        Drink mixing is an art that involves combining different types of
        drinks, usually alcoholic, to create a unique blend of flavors. It's a
        key aspect of bartending and is essential for creating cocktails. The
        process can involve various techniques such as stirring, shaking,
        muddling, and layering. The choice of ingredients, their proportions,
        and the method of mixing can greatly affect the taste of the final
        drink. Some popular mixed drinks include the Margarita, Mojito, and
        Cosmopolitan. Mastering drink mixing requires understanding the
        characteristics of different ingredients and practicing the techniques
        to achieve the desired balance of flavors.
